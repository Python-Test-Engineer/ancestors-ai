# Audio

## TTS

Text To Speech

We can improve the chatbot to speak the answer rather than output text.

We can clone your voice so that the answer is read out to the user in your voice.

## STT

Speech To Text

We can also bypass the keyboard and have the user speak the question to the chatbot.

This will create a conversation chatbot through voice.

[https://elevenlabs.io/](https://elevenlabs.io/) is perhaps the most advance service for this. It does require payment.


## Realtime API

This is OpenAI's API that is trained on audio to audio and does not require the integration of TTS and STT.

## Stories

One additional service is to create a story from the knowledge base that you speak to say grand children. Or it may be a story already created via AI that you can use.
