## Mission

To enable the general user to store to one central Knowledge Base that which they wish to be available after their passing, in the easiest way possible.

To have this Knowledge Base structured and optimised for AI to its magic, which may include a personalised chatbot from text->audio->video output to ultimately creating a Digital Twin to have a Zoom-like convesation with living loved ones.

## User friendly

Using WordPress as the knowledge store, users can add images, notes, thoughts etc in a very user friendly way that will enable AI to work its magic.

With guided tutorials and videos, a user will own their own website with their chosen domain name, e.g. JohnDoe.com, with secure authorisation so that each person has access as you wish.

There is the ability to make public some of the content as you wish via a general website.

### Examples

#### Factual store

Important facts about you and your life can be catalougued and made available according to security rules.

#### Biography

By adding notes in with some meta details, AI could create a biography on an area of your life or all.

#### After life wishes

Not a legal will, yet your wishes and hopes for your estate can be documented in more detail here.

#### Letters 

We often miss out on the opportunity to say things to our loved ones.

Letters can be writted so that you can express yourself fully to your loved ones.

#### Creativity

Artwork, photos, stories, poems etc can also be store here and if you wish you can make these publicly available through the website.
