# Video Overview

We can further enhance the output by have a digital clone of you.

By using images of you and/or video, we can use a number of services that lipsync the audio to the video.

Leaders in this field that alos tend to use ElevenLabs for voice are:

- [https://www.heygen.com/](https://www.heygen.com/)
- [https://www.tavus.io/](https://www.tavus.io/)

This is more involved but the services are getting more advanced and the pricing is getting more reasonable.

An audio chatbot is probably the best way to go if one wants more than a text chatbot.

## To oome!

The lip syncing services above may not seem to b 100% life like.

They are improving but more importantly, there are many AI video services, e.g. [https://www.dzine.ai/](https://www.dzine.ai/), work with real videos that are 100% similar to regular vidoes.

Once the allow an API service - to be called programatically rather than a humana doing this - then digital twin can use this service to give an identical service.

The technology surpasses the services commercially available.
