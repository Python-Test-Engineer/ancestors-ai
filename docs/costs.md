# Costs

## Standard

The first year of hosting with a free domain name is around £30GBP/$40USD per annum.

Thereafter the cost is just under £200GBP or $250USD per annum.

At the end of the first year you can decide not to renew.

WP offers the ability to clone the site and export it or export out just the content.

You can then host elsewhere, locally or just keep the highly structured data to be used in other applications.

I charge £30GBP/$40USD per hour for WP set up and guidance on how to use the system, including any theme development or website creation I may do. Text<->Text chatbots are included.

## Twin

For more technical features like audio and video chatbots, I charge £50GBP/$60USD per hour.

This also includes Cinematic AI work - [Cinematic AI](https://ancestors-ai.com/future/#cinematic_ai).
