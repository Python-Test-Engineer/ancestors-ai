## WP as Knowledged store

There are two main ways we store and present our knowledge:

1. Creating web pages for others to see.

2. Create a set of Question/Answer type entries that are optimised for database and AI processes.

We can have a POST title like 'My first job' with the a body of content about that.

We can put this into various categores like WORK, CAREER etc as well as use TAGS to reference entities.

This could be #acme-ltd for example and we can extend this to people, places and things.

This enables an interconnected network of knowledge to be created and enables queries to select all items relating to a person, place or thing.
