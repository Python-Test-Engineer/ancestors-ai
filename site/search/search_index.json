This isn't science fiction anymore\u2014artificial intelligence is making digital immortality possible through sophisticated avatars that preserve not just memories, but the essence of who we are.</p> <p>AI-powered digital avatars go far beyond simple recordings or photo albums. By analyzing your writing, voice recordings, videos, and personal documents, these systems can create interactive representations that capture your unique personality, knowledge, communication style, and even your sense of humor. Using natural language processing and machine learning, these digital twins can engage in meaningful conversations, share stories from your life, and offer perspectives shaped by your values and experiences.</p> <p>The process typically involves collecting various forms of personal data\u2014emails, social media posts, voice messages, interviews, and written documents. Advanced AI models then learn the patterns in how you think, speak, and express yourself. The result is an avatar that doesn't just replay pre-recorded messages, but can respond dynamically to questions and situations you never explicitly addressed, based on what it has learned about your worldview and personality.</p> <p>For loved ones left behind, these avatars offer profound comfort and connection. Children can learn family history directly from their ancestors. Spouses can continue meaningful exchanges during the grieving process. Future generations can understand their heritage in an intimate, personal way that photographs and videos alone cannot provide.</p> <p>While the technology raises important questions about privacy, consent, and the nature of memory itself, it represents a revolutionary shift in how we think about legacy. For the first time in human history, we can leave behind not just records of our lives, but interactive versions of ourselves\u2014bridging the gap between past and future, ensuring that our wisdom, stories, and love endure for generations to come.</p>"},{"location":"#use_cases","title":"Use cases","text":""},{"location":"#factual_store","title":"Factual store","text":"<p>Important facts about you and your life can be catalougued and made available according to security rules.</p>"},{"location":"#biography","title":"Biography","text":"<p>By adding notes in with some meta details, AI could create a biography on an area of your life or all.</p>"},{"location":"#after_life_wishes","title":"After life wishes","text":"<p>Not a legal will, yet your wishes and hopes for your estate can be documented in more detail here.</p>"},{"location":"#letters","title":"Letters","text":"<p>We often miss out on the opportunity to say things to our loved ones.</p> <p>Letters can be writted so that you can express yourself fully to your loved ones.</p>"},{"location":"#creativity","title":"Creativity","text":"<p>Artwork, photos, stories, poems etc can also be store here and if you wish you can make these publicly available through the website.</p>"},{"location":"#technical_terms","title":"Technical terms","text":"<p>Here are some technical details that are not necessary for the general user:</p> <p>Knowledge Base :   A structured collection of information, data, and expertise on specific topics that can be searched and retrieved.</p> <p>ChatBots :   AI-powered conversational agents that interact with users through text or voice, designed to answer questions and perform tasks.</p> <p>Digital Twin :   An AI-powered representation of a person that captures their knowledge, personality, and communication style.</p> <p>Vector Database :   A specialized database optimized for storing and querying high-dimensional vectors used in AI applications.</p> <p>NLP :   Natural Language Processing - the branch of AI that helps computers understand and generate human language.</p> <p>RAG :   Retrieval-Augmented Generation - an AI technique that combines information retrieval from a knowledge base with text generation to provide more accurate and contextual responses.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"costs/","title":"Costs","text":""},{"location":"costs/#standard","title":"Standard","text":"<p>The first year of hosting with a free domain name is around \u00a330GBP/$40USD per annum.</p> <p>Thereafter the cost is just under \u00a3200GBP or $250USD per annum.</p> <p>At the end of the first year you can decide not to renew.</p> <p>WP offers the ability to clone the site and export it or export out just the content.</p> <p>You can then host elsewhere, locally or just keep the highly structured data to be used in other applications.</p> <p>I charge \u00a330GBP/$40USD per hour for WP set up and guidance on how to use the system, including any theme development or website creation I may do.
